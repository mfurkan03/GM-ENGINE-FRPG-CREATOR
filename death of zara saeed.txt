You find yourself in a seedy bar on the outskirts of New Eden, a city dominated by the powerful corporation Omicron Innovations. The year is 2090, and the air is thick with the smell of smoke and desperation.  You've gathered here with other shady characters, all drawn by rumors of the mysterious underground organization known as the Luminari.

The flickering holographic advertisements casting an eerie glow on the walls of the dimly lit bar illuminate a mix of hackers, mercenaries, and revolutionaries, each sharing a common goal: to take down Omicron's stranglehold on the city.

Nova Snow, seemingly lost in thought,  sips a synthetic cocktail while casually browsing the bar's public networks through her cyberdeck. Kael Jensen, ever cautious, scans the room with a mix of curiosity and suspicion as he enters the bar. He keeps a watchful eye on the patrons while positioning himself near the exit. Lena Lee, deeply engrossed in her research, sits in a corner surrounded by scattered papers and data pads, muttering to herself about Omicron's latest technological advancements. Zara Saeed, commanding attention with her presence, flashes a charming smile as she makes her way to the bar. She seems to be looking for someone specific, exchanging brief, hushed words with the bartender.

 What will you do?

The seedy bar on the outskirts of New Eden hums with the discontent of those who've grown weary of Omicron Innovations' iron grip on the city. You find yourself amidst a gathering of rebels, hackers, and mercenaries, all drawn together by whispers of the shadowy organization known as the Luminari.   Nova Snow, her mind lost in the digital currents, browses the bar's networks through her cyberdeck. Kael Jensen, ever the vigilant one, observes the room from a strategic position near the exit, his gaze betraying a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. Lena Lee, deep in her research, pores over data pads scattered around her, muttering about Omicron's latest technological advancements. Zara Saeed, a beacon of confidence, charms her way through the crowd, seemingly searching for someone specific. 


But the tension in the air breaks as you decide to leave the bar, stepping out into the neon-lit streets of New Eden.  The smoky haze of the bar fades behind you, leaving the city's sprawling cityscape to embrace you.


What will you do next?
