                Easy: DR 12 Medium: DR 16 Hard: DR 20 Very Hard: DR 24 If you have relevant expertise, 
                add +3; if youâ€™re a master, add +5. Character Creation Your character has 3 core attributes: 
                Body : Physical strength, endurance Reflexes : Speed, agility, aim Mind : Intelligence, cyber skills, (you can change the name of the stats based on the theme)
                analysis At character creation, distribute 4, 3, and 1 points among these attributes (total of 8 points). 
                Additionally, choose: One expertise/role (e.g., Netrunner, Street Samurai, Mechanic). 
                One motivation (e.g., Cause chaos, Save family, Seek knowledge). 
                One flaw (e.g., Paranoia, Substance addiction, Ambition).  
                Combat System For initiative, roll 2d10 + REF, highest goes first. 
                For attacks, roll 2d10 + REF or BOD + expertise bonus, aiming to beat the defense DR (typically 16 + enemyâ€™s armor rating). 
                Damage: Light weapons: 1d8 Medium-caliber/one-handed melee weapons: 1d10 Heavy weapons: 1d12 
                The GM can adjust damage based on narrative context and weapon type.  
                Health Each character has 15 + BOD points as Hit Points (HP). When HP drops to zero, the character becomes critically injured 
                and rolls a death die: 1d10 â†’ below 5 means death; 5 or higher means unconscious but alive.  
                Cyber Powers & Hacking Mechanics To use cyber abilities or hack, make a MND-based check: 2d10 + MND + cyber expertise bonus â‰¥ hack 
                DR (DR = 14 + target systemâ€™s security level). On failure, the system triggers an alarm, security responds, and the hacker loses 
                their next action. Advancement At the end of each adventure, the GM awards 1â€“2 advancement points. At 4 advancement points, 
                you can increase an attribute by +1 or gain a new expertise. Acquiring cyber abilities or implants requires GM approval.
