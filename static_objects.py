To succeed, you must meet or exceed the Difficulty Rating (DR) set by the GM: 
Easy: DR 12 Medium: DR 16 Hard: DR 20 Very Hard: DR 24 If you have relevant expertise, 
add +3; if youâ€™re a master, add +5. Character Creation Your character has 3 core attributes: 
Body : Physical strength, endurance Reflexes : Speed, agility, aim Mind : Intelligence, cyber skills, 
analysis At character creation, distribute 4, 3, and 1 points among these attributes (total of 8 points). 
Additionally, choose: One expertise/role (e.g., Netrunner, Street Samurai, Mechanic). 
One motivation (e.g., Cause chaos, Save family, Seek knowledge). 
One flaw (e.g., Paranoia, Substance addiction, Ambition).  
Combat System For initiative, roll 2d10 + REF, highest goes first. 
For attacks, roll 2d10 + REF or BOD + expertise bonus, aiming to beat the defense DR (typically 16 + enemyâ€™s armor rating). 
Damage: Light weapons: 1d8 Medium-caliber/one-handed melee weapons: 1d10 Heavy weapons: 1d12 
The GM can adjust damage based on narrative context and weapon type.  
Health Each character has 15 + BOD points as Hit Points (HP). When HP drops to zero, the character becomes critically injured 
and rolls a death die: 1d10 â†’ below 5 means death; 5 or higher means unconscious but alive.  
Cyber Powers & Hacking Mechanics To use cyber abilities or hack, make a MND-based check: 2d10 + MND + cyber expertise bonus â‰¥ hack 
DR (DR = 14 + target systemâ€™s security level). On failure, the system triggers an alarm, security responds, and the hacker loses 
their next action. Advancement At the end of each adventure, the GM awards 1â€“2 advancement points. At 4 advancement points, 
you can increase an attribute by +1 or gain a new expertise. Acquiring cyber abilities or implants requires GM approval.

The adventurer entered the dark forest in search of the lost Sigil of Aranth. Strange noises echoed through the trees as they pressed deeper. Suddenly, a group of goblins appeared and surrounded the player.

- The player shouted: "I draw my sword and attack the nearest goblin!"
- Rolled a 16 on attack.
- The player hit and dealt 7 damage, slaying one goblin instantly.

### ðŸŒ€ Round 2 - NPC's Turn
- Goblin Chief snarled: "You will pay for that!"
